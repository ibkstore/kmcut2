Title: A package for the optimized Kaplan Meier analysis and identification and validation of prognostic biomarkers.
Version: 2.0
Author: Igor B. Kuznetsov and Javed Khan

Description: The main purpose of the package is to identify  potential prognostic gene signatures and an optimal numeric cutoff for each signature that can be used to classify a group of test subjects (samples) into two sub-groups with significantly different survival (better vs. worse). The main requirement of the package is that for a group of test subjects (such as patients) two types of data are available: (i) right-censored survival time data and (ii) at least one gene expression-like feature with a large proportion of unique values describing each test subject.
